    If you're reading this, you're probably curious about my web development skills.

    This webpage was built in pure HTML and CSS, with an embedded GitHub gist being 
    the only JS on the page. I have used JS before, with the Angular framework,
    and while I am competent in its use I don't like JS on principle.

    That principle is, what on earth is anyone doing using a language that does all 
    math as floats instead of using integers when possible? Whose idea was that?

    And there's a few other weird, poorly considered things like that that tend to
    drive me batty. WebAssembly cannot be ready fast enough.

    Anyway. I am familiar with HTML and CSS, I have used and can use JS, and I am 
    comfortable with the Django framework.

                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>Hi! I'm Cole. I am a passionate, determined, hard worker
                        with an engineer's mind. I specialize in practical
                        applications of computer vision.</p>
                    <p>In times past, I have always found myself at home
                        considering how to make the world a better place without
                        having to start from scratch. This led me to a childhood
                        studying engineering and science, and from that early
                        place I decided to work with computers.</p>
                    <p>In this day and age, being able to work with computers
                        is like having a superpower. Understanding computers,
                        the bits of data and the gates they flow through,
                        enables us to see things that are invisible and change
                        them.</p>
                    <p>From a more practical standpoint, I have experience in
                        both functional and object-oriented programming, as well
                        as a variety of languages. I am proficient in both
                        Python and Java, and have done coursework in the
                        following languages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python</li>
                        <li>Java</li>
                        <li>Raku</li>
                        <li>Kotlin</li>
                        <li>Prolog</li>
                        <li>Postscript</li>
                        <li>x86 assembly through the NASM compiler</li>

                        <li>MATLAB</li>

                    <h3>Previous Work</h3>
                    <p>I've done a lot of work on a lot of projects. Here are
                        the highlights:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>GPEA and its variants: Most recently, I have been
                                employed by Utah State University's Crop Physiology
                                Laboratory.</p>
                            <p>Now what, you might ask, am I doing at a fancy
                                greenhouse? Well, I am building fancy tools
                                for the fancy greenhouse. I am focused on a
                                computer vision system called GPEA, a system that
                                regularly photographs plants and measures their
                                growth rate based on those pictures. It's been
                                a fun project. The current version is called
                                GPEureka, and uses infrared lighting and cameras.
                                A system that combines infrared and color
                                photography is in the works. There is also a
                                Django-based system that displays the data from
                                this system on our university intranet.</p>

                    <p>I've been working professionally since I was 17, when I worked
                        at Pierce College managing budgets and writing manuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are the highlights:</p>

                                Hard work, delivering data and working within others' projects
                                were highlights of my time at the Crop Physiology Laboratory.
                                This is also where I got my feet wet with computer vision. I 
                                have since taken courses in computer vision and am planning to
                                do undergraduate research on this topic.

                                I learned to learn quickly, think on my toes, and make the
                                right decisions quickly during my time at USU Dining Services.
                                I also learned not to let perfect get in the way of complete.

                                No work was too humble here; I started out cooking pizzas to 
                                order for students and was a trusted prep cook in the Catering
                                department by the time I was done.

                                of my time at Grocery Outlet, a small supermarket. As a cashier
                                and as a manager I spent a lot of time keeping customers happy,
                                and I had no complaints from customers while I worked there.
